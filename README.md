### Welcome to Stock Market Simulation API, a GTA V Inspired Application

This is an exciting project developed to explore the depths of [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and expand proficiency in [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming. The concepts of this project were inspired by the game [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/br/gta-v), specically on the [BAWSAQ](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/BAWSAQ) and [LCN](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Liberty_City_National_Exchange) "Fake" Stock Markets. The API provides the basic operations like Buying and Selling Stocks and also provides a feature to simulation the stock market prices variation.
