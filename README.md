### Welcome to the Dumily Sunley a GTA V Inspired Stock Market API

This is an exciting project developed to explore the depths of [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and expand proficiency in [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming. The concepts of this project were based on the game [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/br/gta-v), specically on the [BAWSAQ](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/BAWSAQ) and [LCN](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Liberty_City_National_Exchange) Stock Markets. The API provides the basic operations like Buying and Selling Stocks.
